## Simon Says Verilog README.

We made a simon says game in verilog. The logic behind it involves
matching the randomly chosen square with the corresponding input, and
making the level more difficult and giving points accordingly. It
involves a keyboard and a VGA display.

## Getting Started

Create a Quartus Project with the name ECE2220 so it compiles. Then, put this verilog file in the project folder or copy into the main verilog file.

## Prerequisites

Quartus is free so you don't have to do anything to be able to access it. You do need an FPGA, though, and a monitor to fully utilize this program.

## Deployment

You will need to use an FPGA and a monitor to completely run this program. The pin assignments should be pretty standard due to the nature of the program.

## Built With

Quartus.
